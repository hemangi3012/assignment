    "    GET and POST are two common HTTP methods used to send and receive data over the web. \n",

    "It is used to request data from a specified resource, usually a web server. When a user clicks a link, enters a URL into their browser, or submits a form with the method attribute set to \"GET\", the web browser sends a GET request to the server, which then responds with the requested data. The data is usually appended to the URL as a series of key-value pairs in the form of query parameters.\n",
    "For example, if a user wants to search for a book on Amazon, they might enter a search term in the search box and hit \"submit\". The form will have the method attribute set to \"GET\", and the search term will be sent as a query parameter in the URL like this: https://www.amazon.com/search?q=book. The server would then return a page with a list of search results.\n",

When a user submits a form with the method attribute set to \"POST\", the web browser sends the form data in the body of the request to the server, which then processes the data and returns a response. Unlike the GET method, the data sent using the POST method is not appended to the URL, so it's not visible in the browser's address bar.\n",

    "     In Flask, the request object is used to handle incoming HTTP requests made to the web application. It allows the Flask application to access information sent by the client in the request, such as form data, query parameters, and cookies. Here are a few reasons why the request object is important in Flask:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Accessing form data: When a user submits a form on a web page, the form data is sent to the server in the request. The request object in Flask allows the application to access this form data, which can then be processed and used to generate a response.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Handling query parameters: In addition to form data, the request object can also handle query parameters, which are appended to the URL of a request. This allows the Flask application to retrieve data sent by the client in a way that is easy to read and parse.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Managing cookies: Cookies are small pieces of data stored on the client's computer by the web browser. The request object in Flask allows the application to access these cookies, which can be used to track user sessions and personalize the user's experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Handling HTTP methods: The request object also allows the Flask application to handle different HTTP methods, such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. This allows the application to respond appropriately to the user's request based on the method used.\n",

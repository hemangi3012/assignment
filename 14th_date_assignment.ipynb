    "A thread is the smallest unit of a program or process executed independently or scheduled by the Operating System. In the computer system, an Operating System achieves multitasking by dividing the process into threads. A thread is a lightweight process that ensures the execution of the process separately on the system. In Python 3, when multiple processors are running on a program, each processor runs simultaneously to execute its tasks separately\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a very useful technique for time-saving and improving the performance of an application. Multithreading allows the programmer to divide application tasks into sub-tasks and simultaneously run them in a program. It allows threads to communicate and share resources such as files, data, and memory to the same processor. Furthermore, it increases the user's responsiveness to continue running a program even if a part of the application is the length or blocked.\n",

Just like with logging-in using a social media service, the “Pay with PayPal” functionality is built with APIs to ensure that the end application can only do what it needs to, without being exposed to sensitive data or gaining access to unintended permissions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of the inner-workings of this handy function, it’s very similar to the log-in process described above. When the user clicks the “Pay with PayPal” button, the application sends an “order” request to the PayPal API, specifying the amount owed and other important details. Then, a pop-up authenticates the user and confirms their purchase. Finally, if everything goes to plan, the API sends confirmation of payment back to the application."

With this in mind, this rigid SOAP schema requires additional effort to add or remove the message properties on both sides of the communication, the server and the client. It makes updating requests and responses a tedious process and slows down adoption."
